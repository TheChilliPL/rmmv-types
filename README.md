# RPG Maker MV type declarations
This project is aimed to provide full type declarations for RPG Maker MV API.  
It includes both public and private functions and is dedicated to plugin developers.

Type definitions are made manually, so they may contain some mistakes.  
If you spot one or just feel something could be improved, feel free to
[make an issue][new_issue].
