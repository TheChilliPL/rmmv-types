# RPG Maker MV type declarations
This project is aimed to provide full type declarations for RPG Maker MV API.  
It includes both public and private functions and is dedicated to plugin developers.

Type definitions are made manually, so they may contain some mistakes.  
If you spot one or just feel something could be improved, feel free to
[make an issue][new_issue].

The type definitions should be complete, so provide all the classes and methods
that are available in the RPG Maker MV API, including “private” ones
(starting with an underscore).

The type definitions are, well, as null-safe as I could reasonably assume, but
don't expect strict mode to catch everything. Especially that other plugins
might not be as strict.
